# RISK
This repo was a C++ course semester project.
</br>
It is a text based implementation of Risk, the board game.
</br>
It includes most of the gameplay of the board game with slight variations.
</br>
The project also includes a map creator/editor in order to allow the user to make their own Risk maps, or make modifications to existing maps.
</br>
We learned and implemented quite a few design patterns within the project as well. Design patterns primarily used were the observer, builder, decorator, strategy and adapter patterns.
