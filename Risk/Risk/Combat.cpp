COMBAT NAMESPACE
NOTE: The Combat namepsace is a collection of functions to do with the logic of combat between two countries.
	  The collection consists of several utility functions that when combined simulate the combat mechanic of the board game.
	  The goal of this namespace is to try to keep the combat logic separate from the country logic.

Utility Functions:
int_to_string(i), a function that simply takes an int and converts it to a string equivalent.
desc_order(i, j), a function that will be used to order the dice rolls in descending order for easier analysis.
die_roll(), a function that will simulate the roll of a 6 sided die.
attack_roll(num_armies), a function that given the number of available attacking armies, will roll the corresponding number of dice and push it to a vector.
defend_roll(num_armies), a function that given the number of defending armies, will roll the corresponding number of dice and push it to a vector which will be returned..
attack_results(att), a function that given the result of attack_roll, will store the results in string format which will be returned.
defend_results(def), a function that given the result of defend_roll, will store the results in string format which will be returned.
calculate_results(att, def), a function that given the result of attack_roll and defend_roll will return an int representing the actual calculation of the number of armies lost in battle.
analyze_results(results), a function that given the int value of calculate_results, will store the results in string format which will be returned.
combat_results(num_att, num_def, att_country, def_country), a function that uses all the previous functions to simulate one iteration of a battle, and stores the results in string format which will be returned.
****IN ADDITION, IT ALSO PERFORMS THE APPROPRIATE DECREMENTS OF ARMIES FOR LOSING COUNTRIES.****
move_armies(dice_rolled, att_country, def_country), a function used after a defending country has no armies remaining in order to move an amount of armies from the attacker's country to the defending country.

Actual Combat Function (where the magic happens):
combat(att_country, def_country), a function that given two countries will simulate the entire battle sequence.
