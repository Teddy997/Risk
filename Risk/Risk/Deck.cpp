/*
DECK CLASS
Member variables:
max_deck_size, a const int set to 30 to indicate the max deck size (10 of ID 0, 10 of ID 1, 10 of ID 2).
current_deck, a vector of Cards representing the game deck.

Member functions:
initialize_deck(), a function which creates 30 cards (10 of ID 0, 10 of ID 1, 10 of ID 2) and then pushes them to current_deck. 
shuffle_deck(), a function which randomly orders cards in current_deck

Structs:
Card, a simple struct representing a Card which has only one variable, its ID. 

Functions:
Deck(), the Deck object constructor, which uses initialize_deck() and shuffle_deck() to set up current_deck.
~Deck(), the Deck object destructor.
draw_card(), a function which acts as the drawing mechanism by returning a card from the top of current_deck.
return_card(card), a function which acts as the returning mechanism by taking the card to be returned as a parameter, and returning it to the deck and then shuffling the deck.
